#
# This patch serves a few purposes. The first is matching Protractor semantics
# of lazy finding elements and always relocating elements (ex: element.text)
#
# The second is removing unnecessary bloatware from Watir which has a number
# of checks that don't make sense for angular.js testing. The specifics
# of this patch will change in the next Watir release. Currently version
# 0.7.0 is targeted.
#
# The third is teaching Watir about angular specific locators
#
# Design goal: element.all(by.binding('slowHttpStatus'))
#              should not make any server requests
#
